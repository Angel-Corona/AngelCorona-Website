        <div class="subheading mb-5">Spanish LiteratureðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a Spanish Major at UCR with a concentration in Spanish Literature. What motivated me to study Spanish through higher education was when I saw the need for investigation and research within topics that affect the hispanic/latino/x community. I am working towards finding ways in which I can contribute to this community with my studies. I hope to become a professor at a UC where I can teach topics that matter to me and help create a more diverse working environment for students and faculty. By doing so, I would be able to serve as a role model for future students who share similar backgrounds because I have seen firsthand the impact that a teacher or professor can have on a student simply by representing a shared background/culture. This summer, I will be studying at the Benito JuÃ¡rez Autonomous University of Oaxaca in Mexico. I will be taking courses in Mexican Literature and Activism in Latin America. I am excited to study abroad in a country my parents came from and to take courses specializing in my interests. I will also be part of a Student Leadership Institute for Sustainability trip in Ensenada, Baja California where I will analyze social, environmental, and political factors of sustainability at work in the region.<br><br>

        Currently, I work as a Translator and Community Wellness Intern for the Riverside County Black Chamber of Commerce. At the chamber, I perform a variety of tasks and I utilize my culture and language skills every day. As a bilingual Spanish/English speaker, I use these skills to interpret information between our team and the high Spanish speaking population within the Riverside and San Bernardino counties. By using my language, I am able to connect people with resources and programs that can benefit their health and wealth. For instance, I table at community wellness events where locals can receive free COVID-19 vaccinations, receive blood pressure and blood sugar checks, as well as access to health insurance, dental care, nutrition, etc. I also create flyers in English and Spanish and do a lot of outreach by forming relations with local small businesses and other non-profit organizations to work with them to support the community and develop future events.<br><br>
